## 1. Introduction
[Becker, Gary S. 1993. "The Economic Way of Looking at Life."](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1509&context=law_and_economics)

Econometric modeling used to **isolate causal effects of a treatment**.

### 1.1. What Is Causal Inference?
Definition: theory and **deep knowledge of institutional** details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a outcome of interest. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
